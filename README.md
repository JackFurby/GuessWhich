# GuessWhich

This code is an updated version of the original GuessWhich game which can be found here: [https://github.com/GT-Vision-Lab/GuessWhich](https://github.com/GT-Vision-Lab/GuessWhich). The model has been replaced with an implementation using Python and Pytorch that can be found here: [https://github.com/vmurahari3/visdial-diversity](https://github.com/vmurahari3/visdial-diversity). The packages in use were up to date as of January 2021.

Thank you to the team at [https://visualdialog.org/](https://visualdialog.org/) who provided support on replacing the original Lua model with the compatible Python implementation.

The code in this repository is believed to be mostly functional. Known issues are as follows:
* The feedback form is not currently accepting input
* Conversation history may not be correctly passed into the model input

This repository contains code for setting up the **GuessWhich Game** along with Amazon Mechinical Turk (AMT) integration for real time data collection. The data collection settings can be changed easily by modifying certain configurations defined [here](https://github.com/VT-vision-lab/GuessWhich/blob/master/amt/constants.py).

## Abstract

As AI continues to advance, human-AI teams are inevitable. However, progress in AI is routinely measured in isolation, without a human in the loop. It is important to measure how progress in AI translates to humans being able to accomplish tasks better; i.e., the performance of human-AI teams. In this work, we design a cooperative game â€“ GuessWhich to measure human-AI team performance in the specific context of the AI being a visual conversational agent. The AI, which we call ALICE, is provided an image which is unseen by the human. The human then asks ALICE questions about this secret image to identify it from a fixed pool of images.

We measure performance of the human-ALICE team by the number of guesses it takes the human to correctly identify the secret image after a fixed number of dialog rounds with ALICE. We compare performance of the human-ALICE teams for two versions of ALICE. While AI literature shows that one version outperforms the other when paired with another AI, we find that this improvement in AI-AI performance does not translate to improved human-AI performance.


## Installation Instructions

### Installing the essential requirements

```shell
sudo dnf install -y git python3.7 python-pip python-devel
sudo dnf install -y autoconf automake libtool curl make g++ unzip
sudo dnf install -y gflags-devel glog-devel lmdb-libs
sudo dnf install protobuf-devel leveldb-devel snappy-devel opencv-devel hdf5-devel protobuf-compiler
sudo dnf install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgresql-server openssl-devel
```

### Create Conda enviroemnt and install pip packages

*This has only been tested with Python 3.7*

```
conda create -n GuessWhich python=3.7
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install RabbitMQ and Redis Server

```shell
sudo dnf install -y redis rabbitmq-server
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
sudo service rabbitmq-server restart
sudo systemctl start redis.service
```

### Cuda Installation

Note: CUDA and cuDNN is only required if you are going to use GPU

Download and install CUDA and cuDNN from [nvidia website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

### Install dependencies

1. Follow [https://github.com/vmurahari3/visdial-diversity](https://github.com/vmurahari3/visdial-diversity) to train a RL and SL model

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Cloud-CV/GuessWhich.git
cd GuessWhich
sh download_models.sh
```

### Create the database

*These parameters may need changing if this will be accessible over the internet*

```shell
sudo postgresql-setup initdb
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo su - postgres
psql
CREATE DATABASE guesswhich;
CREATE USER demo WITH PASSWORD 'demo';
ALTER ROLE demo SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE demo SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE guesswhich TO demo;
\q
exit

python manage.py makemigrations amt
python manage.py migrate
```

You will need to change authentication methods in `pg_hba.conf`. `ident` for `IPv4` and `IPv6` local connections should be changed to `md5`.

```
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5
```

Once done you will need to restart Postgress with the command

```shell
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

### Running the RabbitMQ workers and Development Server

Open 3 different terminal sessions and run the following commands:

```shell
cd chatbot && python sl_worker.py -qstartFrom="chatbot/data/sl_qbot.vd" -startFrom="chatbot/data/sl_abot.vd"
cd chatbot && python rl_worker.py  -qstartFrom="chatbot/data/rl_qbot.vd" -startFrom="chatbot/data/rl_abot.vd"
python manage.py runserver
```

You are all set now. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 and you will have your demo running successfully.
